# ANMA — AI-Native Modular Architecture

**Structured contracts that let AI agents understand your codebase in ~250 tokens instead of 5,000-20,000.**

---

## The Problem

AI coding agents waste 70-80% of their context window just *understanding* your codebase before they write a single line of code. Every file read, every dependency traced, every interface guessed — it all burns tokens and produces hallucinations.

Traditional codebases force agents to:
- Read thousands of lines of source to infer interfaces
- Guess at error types and validation rules
- Navigate tangled dependency graphs by trial and error
- Lose context across sessions with no institutional memory

The result: expensive, slow, unreliable AI-assisted development.

## The Solution

ANMA replaces implicit knowledge with explicit YAML contracts. Each module declares exactly what it provides, what it consumes, its invariants, its errors, and its assumptions — in a format optimized for AI consumption.

```yaml
# ~30 lines. An AI agent knows everything it needs.
module: user-auth
version: 1
status: stable

provides:
  - id: register
    input: { email: string, password: string, display_name: string }
    output: { user_id: uuid, token: string }
    errors: [EMAIL_TAKEN, WEAK_PASSWORD, INVALID_EMAIL]
    invariants:
      - "auto-sends verification email"
      - "passwords hashed with bcrypt, min 8 characters"
```

No ambiguity. No guessing. No wasted tokens.

## Real Numbers

A production project using ANMA — 18 modules, 104 interfaces, ~28,000 lines of generated code:

| Metric | Value |
|--------|-------|
| Input tokens per session | ~14,600 |
| Cache read tokens | ~32.8M |
| Total API cost | $31 |
| Modules scaffolded | 18 |
| Interfaces implemented | 104 |
| Tests generated | 239 |
| Time (API) | 91 minutes |

The contracts themselves are ~250 tokens each. A traditional codebase of comparable size would require 5,000-20,000 tokens per module just for an agent to orient itself.

## How It Works

```
your-project/
  CONVENTIONS.yaml      # Universal rules (error format, naming, lifecycle)
  MANIFEST.yaml         # Module registry with status and ownership
  GRAPH.yaml            # Auto-generated dependency graph
  CLAUDE.md             # AI agent instructions
  modules/
    user-auth/
      CONTRACT.yaml     # What this module provides and consumes
      STATE.yaml        # Current work status and blockers
      MEMORY.yaml       # Accumulated knowledge (max 20 entries)
      CHANGELOG.yaml    # Version history
      TESTS.yaml        # Contract-derived test cases
      ASSUMPTIONS.yaml  # Implementation details (separate from contract)
    todo-api/
      CONTRACT.yaml
      ...
  managers/             # Agent groups that own sets of modules
  orchestrator/         # Top-level coordination
  BUS/                  # Inter-module communication
    requests/           # Cross-module change requests
    deltas/             # Contract change notifications
  tools/                # Linting, scaffolding, analysis scripts
```

An agent picking up any module reads 6 files and has full context. No history needed. No onboarding. Design for replacement, not continuity.

## 5-Minute Quickstart

### 1. Clone and explore

```bash
git clone <this-repo> my-project
cd my-project
```

### 2. Run the linter

```bash
python3 tools/lint_contracts.py
```

You should see all 3 example modules pass with 0 errors.

### 3. Scaffold a new module

```bash
python3 tools/new_module.py my-feature --manager core-manager --consumes user-auth
```

This creates `modules/my-feature/` with all 6 required files and updates MANIFEST.yaml.

### 4. Define your contract

Edit `modules/my-feature/CONTRACT.yaml`:

```yaml
module: my-feature
version: 1
status: draft
type: regular

purpose: "What this module does in one sentence"

provides:
  - id: do_something
    input: { user_id: uuid, data: string }
    output: { result_id: uuid }
    errors: [INVALID_DATA, UNAUTHORIZED]
    invariants:
      - "what callers can depend on"

consumes:
  - module: user-auth
    interfaces: [verify_token]
```

### 5. Regenerate the dependency graph

```bash
python3 tools/gen_graph.py
```

### 6. Lint again

```bash
python3 tools/lint_contracts.py --strict
```

Zero warnings = ready to implement.

## Before/After: Token Cost Comparison

### Before ANMA (traditional codebase)

```
Agent reads auth/controllers/user.py          → 850 tokens
Agent reads auth/models/user.py               → 420 tokens
Agent reads auth/serializers.py               → 380 tokens
Agent reads auth/urls.py                      → 120 tokens
Agent reads auth/middleware.py                → 290 tokens
Agent reads auth/tests/test_user.py           → 640 tokens
Agent reads auth/exceptions.py               → 180 tokens
Agent reads requirements.txt (partial)        → 200 tokens
Agent reads settings.py (partial)             → 350 tokens
Agent infers error types (hallucination risk) → ???
                                    Total: ~3,400+ tokens (one module)
```

### After ANMA

```
Agent reads modules/user-auth/CONTRACT.yaml   → 250 tokens
                                    Total: 250 tokens (complete understanding)
```

**~14x reduction per module.** For 18 modules, that's ~61,000 tokens saved per session — enough to fit 3-4 more modules in context or skip an expensive context window entirely.

## Core Concepts

### Contracts over Code
CONTRACT.yaml is the single source of truth. Agents read contracts, not source code. If the contract says an interface returns `EMAIL_TAKEN`, that's what it returns — no need to grep through error handlers.

### Design for Replacement
Any agent can take over any module by reading its 6 files. No onboarding, no tribal knowledge, no context from previous sessions required.

### Explicit Dependencies
GRAPH.yaml shows exactly what depends on what. No hidden imports, no circular dependencies, no surprises. Direct dependencies for synchronous calls, BUS for async fan-out.

### Memory with Limits
MEMORY.yaml keeps institutional knowledge — but capped at 20 entries, 100 chars each. Forces curation over accumulation. Decisions supersede discoveries.

### Contract Lifecycle
Modules progress through: `draft` → `stable` → `frozen`. Frozen contracts can only be extended, never modified. This protects downstream consumers.

## Requirements

- Python 3.8+
- PyYAML (`pip install pyyaml`)

No other dependencies. ANMA is a convention and a set of scripts, not a framework you install.
